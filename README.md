## Overview

I originally started with this repository as an experiment. I wanted to see how feasible a handwritten PHP parser would be.

The goal was to have a set of tools that I could use to write my own utilities. The folders and crates in this repository serve as a guideline and target for the project.

## Goals

* [ ] **A full-featured lexer and parser for PHP 8.1+**
* [ ] An experimental runtime for PHP (excl. extensions)
* [ ] A static-analyser for PHP code.

> Bold text indicates the current goal.
